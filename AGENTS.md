# NHibernate.Extensions.Logging Developer Guidelines

Use Microsoft.Extensions.Logging as an NHibernate logging provider.

## Quick Commands
- Build: `dotnet build -c Release`
- Test: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`
- Restore only: `dotnet restore`
- Check for vulnerable packages: `dotnet list <project> package --vulnerable --include-transitive`

## Architecture Overview
- `src/NHibernate.Extensions.Logging`: the published library. `TargetFrameworks`: `netstandard2.0;net8.0`.
- `test/NHibernate.Extensions.Logging.Tests`: xUnit v3 tests. `TargetFrameworks`: `net10.0;net8.0`. References `src` via `ProjectReference` (no version override), so tests build/run against whatever NHibernate version `src` declares.
- `samples/SampleApp`, `samples/SampleWebApp`, `samples/SampleShared`: usage examples, all `net10.0`, also via `ProjectReference` to `src`.
- `Directory.Packages.props`: central package management (`ManagePackageVersionsCentrally=true`, `CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled=true`).

## Dependency Versioning Policy — read before "fixing" a version

**Do not bump `NHibernate` or `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` in `src/NHibernate.Extensions.Logging/NHibernate.Extensions.Logging.csproj` or the `netstandard2.0` block of `Directory.Packages.props` just because a newer version exists on NuGet, or because it looks out of sync with the central version.** This is intentional, not staleness:

- `src/NHibernate.Extensions.Logging.csproj` pins `NHibernate` via `VersionOverride` (currently `5.4.10`). This is the package's declared **minimum-compatible version (floor)** for consumers — deliberately kept lower than the central `Directory.Packages.props` version (currently `5.7.0`).
- The floor is actually exercised, not just declared: `test/NHibernate.Extensions.Logging.Tests` references `src` via plain `ProjectReference` with no override, so `dotnet test` builds and runs against the floor version.
- The **latest** NHibernate version is validated separately: `samples/SampleShared` depends on `FluentNHibernate`, and with `CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled=true` that pulls in the central (latest) `NHibernate` version. Building the samples is the forward-compatibility check.
- Net effect: CI already covers both ends (oldest supported NHibernate via tests, newest via samples) without an explicit test matrix.
- Only raise the floor when there is a concrete driver — a CVE affecting the current floor (e.g. see git history: `NHibernate before 5.4.9 has SQL injection vulnerability`) or an API the library now depends on that the floor doesn't have. Verify first with `dotnet list <project> package --vulnerable` before assuming a version is a security risk.
- Same reasoning applies to `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions 8.0.3`, which is pinned only for the `netstandard2.0` target in `Directory.Packages.props` (also a floor). The `net8.0` target intentionally has **no** explicit package reference for it — it uses `FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App"` instead, so it always resolves to whatever shared runtime is installed; there is nothing to "upgrade" there.

## TargetFramework Policy

- `src` intentionally targets only `netstandard2.0` and `net8.0` — there is no `#if`-conditional code between them, so there is no functional need for additional TFMs.
- `net8.0` is an LTS release (supported through 2026-11). Because .NET class libraries are forward-compatible, the `net8.0` asset (with its `FrameworkReference`-based dependency) is also what `net9.0`/`net10.0` consumers resolve to — so `netstandard2.0` + `net8.0` already covers older runtimes and all current/future .NET runtimes without adding `net10.0`.
- `test`/`samples` deliberately track the newest SDK (`net10.0`) to catch forward-compatibility issues early; this is independent of what `src` targets and is not evidence that `src` needs to be bumped.
- Revisit the `net8.0` target only when it approaches its own EOL, or when a feature genuinely requires an API not present in `net8.0` — follow the precedent of the `netcoreapp3.1` → `net8.0` migration (a single-TFM swap, not an addition).
